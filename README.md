## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
This app demonstrates a simple concept: interacting with a button to perform an action—in this case, changing the background color to a random shade.Adding animations when the background color changes.
Letting the user save their favorite colors.
Allowing users to toggle between light and dark themes.
Displaying the RGB values of the generated color.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Initially struggled with connecting the button to the IBAction. It required verifying connections in the Storyboard using the Connections Inspector.
witching between the Storyboard and the code editor while linking components took some practice to get used to.
